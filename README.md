# Fashion-MNIST

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items, such as T-shirts, trousers, and shoes, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

# K-Fold Cross Validation

K-Fold Cross Validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the dataset into k equally sized folds. The model is trained k times, each time using kâˆ’1 folds for training and the remaining fold for validation, ensuring that every data point is used for both training and validation exactly once.
